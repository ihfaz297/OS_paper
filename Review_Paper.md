# Quantifying Fairness: A Systematic Survey of Starvation and Resource Allocation in FCFS, Priority, and Round Robin CPU Scheduling

## Abstract
Fairness in CPU scheduling is a fundamental dimension of operating system design that goes beyond traditional performance metrics like throughput and turnaround time. This systematic survey quantifies fairness and starvation across three classic CPU scheduling algorithms: First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Priority Scheduling, and Round Robin (RR). To ensure strict empirical validity, these algorithms are evaluated against a massive scale of **10 distinct, real-world historical trace logs** representing decades of production supercomputing and grid workloads. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of how resource allocation policies impact process waiting times, responsiveness, and equity in authentic heterogeneous environments.

## 1. Introduction to Fairness in CPU Scheduling: Concepts and Challenges
While traditional scheduling evaluation focuses heavily on efficiency (minimizing average waiting time and maximizing throughput), fairness seeks to measure the equality or proportionality of resource allocation. 

- **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)** provides temporal fairness by serving processes strictly in arrival order. However, it is susceptible to the "convoy effect," where short processes wait excessively behind long processes.
- **Shortest Job First (SJF)** represents the theoretical mathematical optimum for minimizing waiting time, but it structurally guarantees extreme unfairness (and starvation) for long-running processes.
- **Round Robin (RR)** enforces fairness through time-slicing. By granting each process an equal quantum of CPU time, it prevents monopolization but often at the cost of increased context-switching overhead and slightly longer average turnaround times.
- **Priority Scheduling** allocates resources hierarchically based on importance. This inherently creates a fairness gradient that can disadvantage lower-priority processes, leading to the risk of indefinite blocking or *starvation*. Advanced implementations attempt to mitigate this using **Aging**.

Quantifying these trade-offs requires multidimensional metrics that capture both the overall system efficiency and the distributional equity of the CPU across the workload.

## 2. Evaluation Parameters and Metrics for Fairness Assessment
To robustly assess scheduling fairness, this study implements a hybrid evaluation framework:

### Primary Performance Parameters
1. **Average Waiting Time (AWT):** Total time processes spend in the ready queue. Efficient schedulers actively minimize this metric.
2. **Average Response Time:** The time from arrival to the first CPU execution. This is a critical indicator of fairness, particularly in interactive computing environments.
3. **Bounded Slowdown & Maximum Bounded Slowdown:** Calculated as Turnaround Time divided by Execution Time. This represents "relative fairness" by measuring the wait penalty a process suffers proportional to its actual size. The *Maximum* Bounded Slowdown reveals the absolute worst-case scheduling anomaly in the entire dataset.
4. **Average Ready Queue Length:** Calculated via Little's Law ($L = \lambda \times W$). This metric translates temporal waiting times into structural system pressure, quantifying how continuously congested the OS memory pipeline is.
5. **Throughput, CPU Utilization, & Makespan:** Baseline structural metrics. Our discrete-event abstraction isolates scheduling fairness by modeling purely work-conserving makespans, ensuring that fairness index penalties are entirely the fault of the dispatch policy rather than raw overhead latency.

### Fairness-Specific Metrics
1. **Jain's Fairness Index (JFI):** Measures the equality of resource allocation, ranging from $1/n$ (worst) to 1 (perfect fairness). It is mathematically scale-independent.
2. **Waiting Time Coefficient of Variation (WT CV):** Calculated as the standard deviation of waiting time divided by its mean. This measures the normalized statistical predictability of the system. A CV > 1 indicates a highly erratic, "heavy-tailed" experience, which users perceive as unfair.
3. **Starvation Rate:** The percentage of processes experiencing unbounded waiting. In our methodology, a process is considered "starved" if its waiting time exceeds three times the average burst duration.

## 3. Real-World Datasets and Workload Patterns
A robust evaluation demands diverse, authentic workload characteristics. We rejected synthetic simulations and instead harvested 10 actual real-world HPC log traces in the Standard Workload Format (SWF) from the foundational Grid Workloads and Parallel Workloads Archives:

1. **SDSC-SP2:** A highly prominent workload log from the San Diego Supercomputer Center SP2 system (1998-2000).
2. **SDSC-BLUE:** Another massive parallel workload log from SDSC reflecting unpredictable job arrivals and bursts.
3. **ANL-Intrepid:** A trace from the Argonne National Laboratory's Blue Gene/P system (2009).
4. **CTC-SP2:** The Cornell Theory Center's historical HPC log (1996).
5. **HPC2N:** Trace from the High-Performance Computing Center North (2002).
6. **KTH-SP2:** Trace from the Swedish Royal Institute of Technology (1996).
7. **CEA-Curie:** Workload from the Curie supercomputer operated by CEA in France (2011).
8. **PIK-IPLEX:** Cluster workload log from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (2009).
9. **RICC:** The RIKEN Integrated Cluster of Clusters trace out of Japan (2010).
10. **Lublin-1024:** A highly validated, historically significant benchmark trace modeling extreme heterogeneity.

## 4. Methodology for Fairness Quantification
A discrete-event simulation framework modeled the CPU scheduling behavior sequentially processing 200 chronological jobs from each of the 10 massive trace logs. Schedulers evaluated included FCFS, Priority, Round Robin, SJF, and Priority with Aging (where priority dynamically increases roughly every ten full mean burst cycles). For Round Robin, the time quantum was dynamically configured to roughly **half the mean CPU burst time** for each respective dataset to balance responsiveness with context-switch optimization.

## 5. Experimental Results and Analysis

### Average Waiting Time (AWT) & The SJF Baseline
![AWT](images/AWT.png)
- **Observations:** Real-world workloads are notoriously heavy-tailed and bursty. As the theoretical optimum, **SJF universally annihilated the Average Waiting Time** compared to all other algorithms. For example, in the SDSC-SP2 trace, SJF achieved an AWT of ~105,000 ms compared to FCFS at ~824,000 ms. However, SJF pays for this efficiency with severe structural unfairness to long jobs. **Round Robin** served as a highly effective middle ground, consistently outperforming the FCFS "Convoy Effect" while preventing the severe discrimination inherent to SJF.

### Responsiveness and Bounded Slowdown
![Response Time](images/Response_Time.png)
![Bounded Slowdown](images/Bounded_Slowdown.png)
![Max Bounded Slowdown](images/Max_Bounded_Slowdown.png)
- **Observations:** Round Robin guarantees dramatically superior response times across the entire board of 10 real-world traces. Furthermore, the **Bounded Slowdown** metric reveals exactly how deeply unfair FCFS is to small jobs. In SDSC-SP2, the FCFS average Bounded Slowdown was 46,412, while the **Maximum Bounded Slowdown** reached a catastrophic 1,120,413. This meant a tiny job was forced to wait over one million times its execution length simply because it was stuck in an FCFS convoy. Time-slicing (RR) is functionally mandatory for relative fairness in bursty HPC scenarios.

### Jain's Fairness Index (JFI) & System Predictability (WT CV)
![JFI](images/JFI.png)
![WT CV](images/WT_CV.png)
- **Observations:** Fairness scoring fluctuates uniquely on raw data compared to theoretical data. **SJF**, despite being the most "efficient" algorithm, consistently records the absolute worst JFI scores across the traces (e.g., 0.14 in SDSC-SP2). This extreme unfairness is backed up by the **Waiting Time Coefficient of Variation (WT CV)**. SJF's WT CV spiked to 2.41 in the SDSC-SP2 trace, representing a wildly erratic, heavy-tailed wait experience. Conversely, Round Robin smoothed out the experience for the vast majority of jobs. FCFS ironically scores high mathematical JFIs because it forces everyone behind the convoy to suffer equally (raising JFI mathematically because misery is equally distributed).

### System Congestion and Average Queue Length
![Average Queue Length](images/Average_Queue_Length.png)
- **Observations:** Queueing theory predicts system failure not just by wait times, but by memory pressure. Using Little's Law, we mapped the **Average Ready Queue Length** for each algorithm. Because FCFS suffers the Convoy Effect, its queue length swells violently. In the KTH-SP2 trace, FCFS maintained an average queue length of 117 concurrent processes. By time-slicing long jobs, Round Robin successfully bled the queue dry down to just 13 concurrent processes. Round Robin doesn't just feel fairer to the user; it actively protects the operating system from catastrophic memory congestion.

### Starvation Rates, Preemption, and the Failure of Linear Aging
![Starvation Rate Pct](images/Starvation_Rate_Pct.png)
- **Observations:** Absolute starvation exists across the board in all 10 traces during non-preemptive Priority execution, often hitting a **Starvation Rate of 99%**. Notably, the implementation of **Priority Scheduling with Aging** generally failed to significantly rescue the lowest-priority jobs from starvation in highly bursty traces like SDSC-SP2. In real-world HPC environments, the sheer volume and rate of new job arrivals often vastly outpaces the linear priority inflation of decaying processes. Meaningful starvation mitigation requires exponential aging algorithms, not linear ones.

## 6. Conclusion
This expansive systematic quantification on 10 explicit real-world HPC trace logs confirms a core fundamental tension in operating system design: **Algorithms that maximize theoretical mathematical fairness (FCFS JFI) or theoretical peak efficiency (SJF) rarely align with actual user responsiveness, relative fairness, and system stability.** 

FCFS forces severe "mathematical fairness" under these highly skewed historical workloads simply by enforcing a brutal convoy; equal suffering results in a high mathematical fairness score but a catastrophic Maximum Bounded Slowdown (over 1,000,000x penalty) and immense active memory congestion in the Ready Queue. SJF achieves absolute optimal Average Waiting Time but relies on structural starvation that ruins its JFI score and drives its Wait Time Coefficient of Variation into erratic territory. Priority scheduling aligns strictly to organizational hierarchies, but simple linear Aging mechanics are helpless against the sheer burst velocity of real-world supercomputers, resulting in systemic starvation rates exceeding 90%.

Round Robin proves to be the ultimate practical synthesis for bursty, real-world datasets exactly like the SDSC, KTH, and CEA-Curie historical archives. It aggressively drops maximum responsiveness latencies, controls Bounded Slowdown for small tasks, massively alleviates Ready Queue pressure, and ensures low Starvation Rates, all despite an explicit mathematical tax in JFI. For highly variant empirical HPC queue patterns, periodic preemption acts as an indispensable equalizer.
